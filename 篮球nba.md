### 后卫

 advance the ball to the hoop

advance it toward the hoop,

 On a basketball squad

 the point guard, a position that requires exemplary ball-handling skills.

deter defensive players from stealing the ball

create fast-break opportunities

open up a clean look at the basket.

Slapping the ball with the palm 





dribble drive motion offense (DDM)

attack the interior of a [zone defense](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/man-to-man-vs-zone-defense) and draw multiple defenders.

Once a ball handler has attacked within the free throw line area, they can attempt an open [layup](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/layup-basketball-guide) or “kick back” the ball to open shooters.



they would counter with dribble penetration and skilled perimeter players around the three-point line.



The dribble drive offense aims to attack the double gaps and triple gaps (**unguarded**（松懈区域） areas of the floor) between defenders.

### 无球

As a weak-side defender，，All perimeter players without the ball should maintain spacing between their teammates. 



As a weak-side defender rotates to help on a drive,

 properly spaced shooters can prepare to receive a lob pass from the ballside of the court and attempt a three-point shot. 

 the perimeter players should swing the ball around the arc with crisp passes （不运球，直接传球，形容传球比较快，）that force the defense to rotate once more. 

Weak passes can lead to steals and turnovers if weak-side [defenders](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/learn-how-to-read-and-react-to-your-defender-with-steph-curry) station themselves near passing lanes.



drop zone defense, help-side defenders must compress the zone. This compression creates more distance that a defender must **travel（形容防守距离远，扑防** to close out on a potential shooter. 



If the on-ball defender overcommits（形容被晃到，防守动作大了些，失去了位置） to the fake, they will be unable to defend a driving attack to the hoop.（篮筐）

A dribble drive offense must place pressure on the defense to rotate



A perimeter player can perform a skip pass when they receive the ball at the “short corner”—where the three-point arc meets the baseline.

pop back represent a player cut towards the rim but if he doesnot receive a pass(the arc-ball handler doesnot pass the ball for the first time ,) the player TWO pop back out to the base line.



sagged down into the key player



skip pass is when you pass over a player on your team which the receiving player is also on your team

 **The passer** will then move along the baseline and replace the perimeter player at the short corner. 



Once the defense becomes accustomed to this cycle, the offense can alter this motion with an off-ball screen or **backdoor cut.**

### 防守

Man-to-Man vs. Zone Defense: Inside the Basketball Defenses

Walberg’s team did not have the luxury of a dominant post player who could post up inside and force weak-side defenders out of position. 



took a page from Walberg’s playbook 

 The ball handler—usually a [point guard](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/key-basketball-positions)—of a dribble drive offense is like a general（**n.**将军；（陆军、海军陆战队或美国空军）上将） who orchestrates（安排） troop movements on a battlefield.

double——team



To determine which alignment to use, coaches must evaluate their team's specific situation because their **roster configuration** may favor one defense over the other.



each player on the line-up



some teams prefer to use gender-neutral variations, such as "player-to-player" or "person-to-person."



### 投篮

shooting motion—which requires a combination of stance, alignment, and hand positioning

1. **Stance**. How you position your feet, the direction in which they point, and how to support the jump shot motion from the ground up.
2. **Alignment**. How your body aligns from your feet through your shoulders to support the fluid（流体） jump shot motion.
3. **Hand positioning**. How you position your dominant shooting arm and shooting hand, how you support that positioning with your non-dominant off hand (or guidehand), how you position your index and middle finger, and how you release the ball based on this hand positioning.
